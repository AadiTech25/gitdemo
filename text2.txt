Areas to Focus On:
Conflict Resolution: As you collaborate more, youâ€™ll face merge conflicts. Learning how to resolve them will be important.
Advanced Git Features: Explore topics like rebase, cherry-pick, stashing, and tags to handle complex scenarios.
GitHub Workflow: Once you're comfortable with Git commands, try using pull requests, forks, and issues for collaborative projects.
Git Ignore: Make sure you understand .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files from being tracked by Git.
